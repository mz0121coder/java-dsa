# Java Data Structures & Algorithms

I'm currently working through the challenges in Scott Barett's Java DSA course.

It is a great course with a lot of practice and clear, animated examples to explain the theory.

You can view my progress in the `data-structures/src` folder.

Each data structure will have its own folder with solutions when completed, starting with linked lists.

In the future I might add my solutions to LeetCode problems here.
