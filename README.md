I am completing challenges from the Java Data Structures & Algorithms course by Scott Barett.

It is a great course with a lot of practice and clear, animated examples to explain the theory.

You can view my solutions in the `data-structures/src` folder.

Each data structure will have its own folder with solutions when completed, starting with linked lists.
